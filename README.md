#  COVID-19 Metrics by US County | CovidActNow

The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/fred-data-products](https://github.com/rearc-data/fred-data-products).

## Main Overview
The dataset file included with this product is provided in CSV format. Data definitions are as follows: 

-  Cases

   - Cases
   
        - Cumulative confirmed or suspected cases.  

        - Column name: **actuals.cases**

   - New Cases

        - New confirmed or suspected cases.

        - New cases are a processed timeseries of cases - summing new cases may not equal the cumulative case count.

        - Processing steps:

          1. If a region does not report cases for a period of time but then begins reporting again, we will exclude the first day that reporting recommences. This first day likely includes multiple days worth of cases and can be misleading to the overall series.

          2. We remove any days with negative new cases.

          3. We apply an outlier detection filter to the timeseries, which removes any data points that seem improbable given recent numbers. Many times this is due to backfill of previously unreported cases.

        - Column name: **actuals.newCases**

   - Case Density  
   
      - The number of cases per 100k population calculated using a 7-day rolling average.

   - Infection Rate Ci90

       - 90th percentile confidence interval upper endpoint of the infection rate.

       - Column name: **metrics.infectionRateCI90**

- Tests

    - Positive Tests
    
      - Cumulative positive test results to date
      
      - Column name: **actuals.positiveTests**

  - Negative Tests
  
    - Cumulative negative test results to date

    - Column name: **actuals.negativeTests**

  - Test Positivity Ratio
 
    - Ratio of people who test positive calculated using a 7-day rolling average.

    - Column name: **metrics.testPositivityRatio**

  - Icu Beds
  
    - Information about ICU bed utilization details.

    - Fields:

        Field | Description | Column Name
        ---|---|---
        capacity | Current staffed ICU bed capacity | actuals.icuBeds.capacity
        total usage | Total number of ICU beds currently in use | actuals.icuBeds.currentUsageTotal

        usage rate | Typical ICU utilization rate | actuals.icuBeds.typicalUsageRate
        
  - Hospital Beds
    
    - Information about acute bed utilization details.

    - Fields:
        
        Field | Description | Column Name
        ---|---|--- 
        capacity | Current staffed acute bed capacity | actuals.hospitalBeds.capacity
        total usage | Total number of acute beds currently in use | actuals.hospitalBeds.currentUsageTotal
        COVID usage | Number of acute beds currently in use by COVID patients | actuals.hospitalBeds.currentUsageCovid
        usage rate | Typical acute bed utilization rate | actuals.hospitalBeds.typicalUsageRate
           
  - Icu Capacity Ratio  

    - Ratio of staffed intensive care unit (ICU) beds that are currently in use.

    - Column name: **metrics.icuCapacityRatio**

  - Icu Headroom Ratio

    - Column name: **metrics.icuHeadroomRatio**
